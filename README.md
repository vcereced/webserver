## âœ¨ What is webserv?
`webserv` is an HTTP server built from scratch in C++98. Itâ€™s made to work with real browsers and aims to support much of the HTTP/1.1 standard. This project tests your understanding of sockets, process management, server configuration, and handling HTTP requests.

## Features
- Handles multiple connections using `epoll()`.
- Non-blocking I/O.
- Works with real-world browsers.
- Supports HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`.
- Serves static files.
- File upload support.
- CGI support (e.g., PHP, Python).
- Multiple ports and virtual servers.
- NGINX-style configuration file.
- Default error pages.

## Requirements

- C++98 (compiled with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`)
- No Boost or external libraries allowed.
- Must be 100% stable â€” no crashes allowed under any condition.
- Compatible with Linux and macOS (with some platform-specific constraints).

## ðŸ’» Usage

Use `make` to compile the project.

Run it with:

```bash
./webserv ./conf/server.conf
